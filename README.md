The link provided directs you to a random allocator page, which is particularly useful for experimental trials requiring random allocation to prevent selection bias. This tool ensures greater reliability and adherence to standards, especially in scenarios where achieving true randomness (such as in convenience sampling) can be challenging.
If you need to access and make changes to this application, the R script codes for this application can be accessed for execution in R Studio. 

On entering into the link directly or through running the r script code, the Random allocator web application page opens up displaying sections to make custom entries.
**In the section Study title:** The name of the study or any custom number can be entered.
Then on further entering the required details, by clicking on to the Allocate now option, can display the complete list of subject allocation.
The random subject allocation along with the time stamp for evidence, can be downloaded in a compatible word format along with the entered details for identification of studies.
